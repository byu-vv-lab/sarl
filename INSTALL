                    SARL Installation Instructions

======================= Installation from source =======================

1. Install a Java 7 SDK if you have not already.  Go to
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ for the
latest from Oracle.  On linux, you can optionally sudo apt-get install
openjdk-7-jdk.

2. Install Apache ant, if you don't already have it
(http://ant.apache.org).

3. Download the tgz archives of vsl_$os$-1.0.tgz from
   http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/tools/vsl_depend,
   choose the right .tgz according to your platform (64-bit mac osx, 64-bit linux 
   or 32-bit linux) and unzip it put the folder /vsl at /opt/vsl on your system. 

4. svn checkout svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/sarl/trunk sarl

5. cd sarl

6. Type "ant" and everything should build without warnings or errors
and produce sarl.jar.  Type "ant test" to run a JUnit test suite.  All
tests should pass.

If there are any problems, email siegel at udel dot edu.

============== Installation from source using Eclipse ==================

1. Start with Eclipse IDE for Java/EE developers, available at
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
You need at least version Kepler (which comes with JUnit 4.11)

2. Do steps 1-3 from above if you have not already.

3. Install an SVN plugin in Eclipse (such as Subversive) if you have
not already.

4. From within Eclipse, select New Project...from SVN.  The archive is
svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/sarl.  After entering that, open it up and
select the "trunk". (It is simplest to just check out the trunk for
the Eclipse project.)

5. Check out the trunk, and create the project using the New Java
Project Wizard as usual, naming it "SARL".  The .project, .classpath,
and other Eclipse meta-data are already in the SVN archive, saving you
a bunch of work.

6. Do a clean build.  Everything should compile.  Generate the sarl.jar
by right-clicking (or ctrl-click on OS X) the build.xml file and
Run As->Ant Build.  

7. Go to Run->Run Configurations....  Create a new JUnit configuration.
Name it SARL Tests.  Select "Run all tests in the selected project..."
and navigate to the folder "test" in the SARL project.
The Test runner should be JUnit 4.  Under the Arguments tab, type
"-ea" (without the quotes) in the VM arguments area (to enable assertion
checking).     Under the Environment tab, add an entry
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH = /opt/vsl/lib (OS X) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /opt/vsl/lib (linux).
