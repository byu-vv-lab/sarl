/**
 * <p>
 * An immutable collection of symbolic expressions. Though immutable, these
 * collections support analogs of the usual mutation operations that return new
 * collections instead of modifying the collection. This is sometimes referred
 * to as a "persistent" collection.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Equality: for two symbolic collections to be equal, they must have the same
 * {@link SymbolicCollectionKind}. Further requirements for each kind:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link BASIC}: the underlying collections must be equal,</li>
 * <li>{@link SET}: either both are sorted, or both are unsorted; furthermore,
 * they define the same set of symbolic expressions,</li>
 * <li>{@link SEQUENCE}: both define the same sequence of elements, i.e., they
 * have the same size and the same elements occur in the same order in both;</li>
 * <li>{@link MAP}: either both are sorted, or both are unsorted; furthermore,
 * they define the same set of key-value pairs.</li>
 * </ul>
 * As can be seen from the above requirements, it is usually not advisable to
 * mix different sorts of symbolic collections in the same context, because
 * equality will not behave as you would expect. For example, two symbolic sets
 * which contain the same elements may be unequal, because one is sorted and the
 * other is not.
