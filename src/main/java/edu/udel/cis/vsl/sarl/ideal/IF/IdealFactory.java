/**
 * <p>
 * An {@link IdealFactory} provides a few services beyond those guaranteed by an
 * arbitrary {@link NumericExpressionFactory}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * The ideal factory produces and manipulates the following kinds of numeric
 * expressions:
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Constant} represents a concrete value. Each constant has either
 * integer or real type.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Primitive} expression is one which is not concrete and cannot be
 * expressed as a sum or product or quotient of other expressions. Examples:
 * symbolic constants, array read expressions of integer or real type, tuple
 * read expressions of integer or real types, function applications for
 * functions returning integer or real.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any value which is the result of raising a primitive expression to a concrete
 * positive integer power is an instance of {@link PrimitivePower}. Any
 * {@link Primitive} is also a {@link PrimitivePower} by taking the exponent to
 * be 1.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Monic} is the product of {@link PrimitivePower}s. Any
 * {@link PrimitivePower} is also a {@link Monic}: it is the product of a single
 * primitive-power. The {@link Constant} 1 (integer or real) is also a
 * {@link Monic}: it is the empty product. The integer and real 1s are the only
 * constants which are also {@link Monic}s.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Monomial} is the product of a {@link Constant} and a {@link Monic}.
 * Any {@link Constant} is also a {@link Monomial} by taking 1 for the monic.
 * Any {@link Monic} is also a {@link Monomial} by taking 1 for the constant.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Polynomial} is the sum of {@link Monomial}s. Any {@link Monomial} is
 * a {@link Polynomial} (a sum with one term).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link RationalExpression} is the quotient of two {@link Polynomial}s. Any
 * {@link Polynomial} is also a {@link RationalExpression} by taking the
 * denominator to be the (polynomial) 1. Any {@link RationalExpression} of
 * integer type is also a {@link Polynomial}. (The result of integer division of
 * two integer polynomials may be a {@link Primitive} expression with operator
 * {@link SymbolicOperator#INT_DIVIDE}.)
 * </p>
 * 
 * A relational numeric expression will always be in one of the following forms:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>0&lt;p</code></li>
 * <li><code>0&le;p</code></li>
 * <li><code>0=p</code></li>
 * <li><code>0&ne;p</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * where <code>p</code> is a {@link Polynomial}.
