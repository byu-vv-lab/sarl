<strong>SARL: The Symbolic Algebra and Reasoning Library</strong> is a Java-based library for
creating, manipulating, and reasoning about symbolic expressions.  The library
can be used to support various applications that require symbolic reasoning, such as
symbolic execution tools for program analysis, verification, or test case generation.
</p>

<p>
Some of the features of SARL include:

</ul>
<li><strong>Symbolic references.</strong>
There is a "reference type" which has symbolic values such as r1="the i-th element of an array",
or "the i-th field of the j-th element of an array of tuples".
There is a method "dereference" that takes a reference value and a symbolic expression of the
appropriate type and returns the subexpression specified by the reference.
For example, dereference(r1, a) will return "a[i]".
This make representing pointer values in a C program really easy.
There is also a method assign(r, x, y), which returns the symbolic expression obtained by
starting with x and modifying the component specified by r with y.
This makes the symbolic execution of C statements like "*p=e" easy.
</li>
<li><strong>Union types.</strong>
Given any sequence of types t1,...,tn, you can form the union type t1+...+tn.
The domain of this type is the union of the domains of the ti.  This makes
representing a heap easy, for example, let t1,...,tn be all the types that
are ever malloced, let the heap type be: array of union_i(array of ti).
It also useful for message queues, which are arrays that can hold various
types of elements.
</li>
<li><strong>Simplifications.</strong>
Given a boolean-valued expression (the "context") and another symbolic expression,
the simplify method returns a simplified version of the expression under the
assumption that the context holds.  For example, if context is "x>1" and e is
"x>0" then e is simplified to "true".  If the context contains a bunch of polynomial
equalities, these are treated as linear expressions in the monomials and Gaussian
elimination is performed to solve for any/all of those monomials.  And so on.
This is useful in symbolic execution, where the context is the path condition,
and you can run over the whole state simplifying it, getting the state to
(as close as possible to) a canonical form.  This can help you decide if you have
seen the state before, greatly simplifies the theorem proving queries, etc.
</li>
<li><strong>Persistence.</strong>
Symbolic expressions are immutable, but they are implemented with "persistent"
data structures.    This is a concept from Clojure and other functional languages.
These are immutable data structures that provide analogs of all the standard
mutation methods (like "set the i-th element of the array to x") but return
a whole new data structure instead of modifying the existing one, i.e.:
<code>
 PersistentArray<T> set(int index, T x);
</code>
You might think this would have bad (linear in length of array) performance because you
have to create a whole new copy of the array to change one element.  However, the
persistent data structures are implemented in a very clever way --- the array
internally is a tree with a big branching degree, and all the operations are
log time (actually, log base 32) --- because the "new" array and the "old" array
share most nodes in the tree.    I believe this has the potential to really speed
up symbolic execution even while saving all the states you want.
</li>
<li><strong>Herbrand versions of the numeric types.</strong>
In addition to the (ideal) integer and real types, there are
Herbrand integer and Herbrand real types.    A numerical operation involving
a Herbrand type is treated as an uninterpreted function (and never simplified).
Hence in one program you can mix and match: have some Herbrand and some ideal values.
The Herbrands are useful, for example, for representing floating point values
when you don't want to assume anything about the floating point operations.
</li>
</ul>
