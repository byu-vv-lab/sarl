# This is a SARL configuration file.  It specifies information
# about each automated theorem prover available to SARL.

# for a file named .sarl.  If it doesn't find that,
# it will look in the same directory for .sarl_default.
# If it doesn't find that, it will look in the user's
# home directory for .sarl, then in the user's home
# directory for sarl_default.
