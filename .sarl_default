# This is a SARL configuration file.  It specifies the full path
# to each automated theorem prover that may be used by SARL.
# It is needed for executing the SARL test suite.
# Other applications that use SARL as a library do not have
# to use a SARL configuration file.  They can just specify
# the paths using the SARL API.
#
# The format: one line for each tool.
# The line has the form:
#
# alias-list : kind : path : version
#
# The alias-list is a comma-separated list of strings.
# All of the aliases in the list refer to the same prover.
# The kind refers to the kind of input language accepted
# by the tool.  It is one of the following: CVC3, CVC4.
# (More coming soon.)
# The path is the full path to the executable tool.  The
# version is the version string of that tool.  It is possible
# to have multiple instances of a single tool by using different
# aliases for each.
# White space is ignored (except for the newlines), and
# any line starting with '#' is ignored.
# Example:
#
# cvc3,cvc3a : CVC3 : /opt/vsl/bin/cvc3 : 3.192
# cvc3b : CVC3: /usr/local/bin/cvc3 : 2.78
# cvc4,cvc4a : CVC4 : /usr/local/bin/cvc4 : 1.3
#
# SARL will look first in the current working directory
# for a file named .sarl.  If it doesn't find that,
# it will look in the same directory for .sarl_default.
# If it doesn't find that, it will look in the user's
# home directory for .sarl, then in the user's home
# directory for sarl_default.

cvc4x : CVC4     : /opt/local/bin/cvc4 : 1.4
# cvc4a : CVC4_API :                     : 1.4
cvc3  : CVC3_API :                     : UNKNOWN
