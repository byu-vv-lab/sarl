universe
  uses: reason, preuniverse

reason
  uses: simplify, prove, ....

herbrand
  uses: like ideal?
  
ideal
  uses: simplify, prove, ...
  ideal.simplify uses preuniverse
  
prove
  uses: IF, cvc3, expr, 
    preuniverse (to build expressions)
 
simplify
  uses: IF, type, expr, object,
    preuniverse (by CommonSimplifier)

preuniverse: everything in universe except reasoning
  uses: expr, type, collections, object, number, util, IF

expr
  uses: IF
        object
        collections
        type

type
  uses: IF (expr array len),
        object

collections
  uses: IF
        object

object: symbolic objects
  uses: IF
        collections (SymbolicCollection for comparator): CHANGE!

number: arbitrary-precision integer and real numbers
  uses: IF (IF.number)

util: utility classes
  uses: nothing

IF: public interface
  uses: nothing
  comprises:
    IF.SymbolicUniverse
    IF.Reasoner
    IF.ValidityResult

Design issues:

  - massive duplication between SymbolicUniverse and PreUniverse
  - cyclic dependency object<-->collections

Heaps:

/** This is the type for head IDs.  Every heap has an unchanging
 * heap ID.  As objects are added or removed from the heap, the
 * heap expression itself changes, but the underlying heap ID
 * is constant.  References to heap objects always include the
 * heap ID indicating to which heap the reference points.  This
 * is necessary so that when we canonicalize a heap, we can 
 * determine which references refer to that heap and therefore
 * must be updated. */
SymbolicType heapIdType();

/** This is the type of a heap. */
SymbolicType heapType();

/** Returns the incomplete reference type, which is a super-type
 * of all reference types.  Situation is analogous to array types.
 */

/** Returns type "reference-to-T", where T is the given type.
 * This is a complete reference type. */

/** Returns a heap ID which simply wraps the given string object.
 * Two heapIds with equal names are equal. */

/** Returns the empty heap with the given heap ID. */
SymbolicExpression emptyHeap(SymbolicExpression heapId);

/** Allocates an object on the heap.  Returns a pair: the first
 * component is the new heap, the second is reference to the new
 * object in the new heap. */

/** Deallocates an object on the heap.  Given a heap and a reference
 * to an element on the heap, returns the new heap which is obtained
 * by removing the referenced object from the original. Result

/** Canonicalize heap.
