Think about how to do quick dispatch to right routine for
numeric operation.

Implement floating point numbers and finite integer numbers.

Support pointers?

Support a type which is a pair (p, e) where p is a boolean expression
and e is an expression of any time.  This pair represents the set
{e(x)|p(x)}.  simplify, operations, translation, ...

(int t>0, t^2) = {1,4,9,...}

equality?

y in S(p,e) iff exists x0 s.t. p(x) and y=e(x)

S(p,e) subset of S(q,f):
  forall x. p(x) => exists y. (q(y) && e(x)=f(y)) 
  
Example:
  {(x,y)| x>0 && y>0}
  {(y,x)| x>0 && y>0}
  
Canonicalization of symbolic constant names:
walk through structures in ordered way and re-name.
what about unordered structures??
