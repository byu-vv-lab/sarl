Making flyweighting of numbers optional.

Make some kind of SARLConfiguration class encapsulating options such as:
  flwyeightNumbers, flyweightExpressions, flyweightTypes, flyweightObjects,
  etc.   These can be fed to universe.

Finish implementing universe methods. 

Think about how to do quick dispatch to right routine for
numeric operation.

Need proper comparison methods
  Primitives (used as keys to factorMap)
  Monics (used as keys to termMap)
  others?

comparisons on SymbolicObject: decomposed by kind
SymbolicExpression
NumericExpression : can have own order
...

want to order Monics by degree.

total order on numeric expressions

1. NTRationalExpression  (/)
2. NTPolynomialExpression  (+) : order
3. NTMonomial (*) : order by monic, then constant
4. NTMonic  (*) : order by degree, then dictionary
5. NTPrimitivePower (POWER)
   ReducedPolynomial (+) (extends NumericPrimitive)
6. NumericPrimitive (anything)
7. Constants (CONCRETE) (including ONE)
