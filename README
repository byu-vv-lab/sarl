            SARL: Symbolic Algebra and Reasoning Library
                     http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/sarl
            
=============================== ABOUT =================================

SARL is a Java library for symbolic algebra reasoning.  It supports
the creation and manipulation of typed symbolic expressions,
and the ability to verify the validity of first order formulas.
It uses ("under the hood") automated theorem provers (currently
just CVC3) to assist in the verification tasks.  It also is
very effective at placing symbolic expressions in a canonical form,
in order to easily tell if two expressions are equivalent.  It
supports real (mathematical) integers and reals, as well as
Herbrand integers and reals (where the numeric operations are
treated as uninterpreted functions).  

SARL is written by Stephen Siegel, University of Delaware.

============================ INSTALLATION =============================

If you only want to use SARL (and not contribute to its development)
you only need to download and build the automated theorem prover
CVC3 and then download sarl.jar and place it in the CLASSPATH
for your application.  See file INSTALL in this directory
for some hints on building CVC3.   In order for your application
to find CVC3 you will need to set your DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (on OS X)
or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on linux) to a colon-separated list of directories
which contain the CVC3 shared libraries and the GMP (GNU Multiple
Precision arithmetic library) shared library.  You will also need
a Java 7 SDK.

If you want to install from source (e.g., because you want to develop
SARL), it is a bit more complicated, because SARL requires
all of the following:

 - Java SE 7 SDK
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
 - Apache Ant (build tool):
   http://ant.apache.org 
 - CVC3 (automated theorem prover):
   http://www.cs.nyu.edu/acsys/cvc3/download.html
 - clj-ds (Clojure's persistent data structures in pure Java):
   https://github.com/krukow/clj-ds
 - PCollections (another persistent data structure library):
   http://code.google.com/p/pcollections/
 - JUnit (automated testing framework):
   https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads
 - JaCoCo (Java code coverage analysis tool):
   http://www.jacoco.org

[Note that Hamcrest is now needed with JUnit 4.11 and later:
 - Hamcrest (a library of "matchers"):
   https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest
]
   
See file INSTALL in this directory for detailed instructions on
installing SARL from source.
